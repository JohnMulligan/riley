This repository contains some preliminary scripts for creating matrices and graphical representations of them, based on Bridget Riley's _Messengers_ and her _Measure for Measure_ series.

## messengers.py

This script does the core, abstract work here.

Example output:

<img src="https://github.com/JohnMulligan/riley/raw/master/sample%20outputs/natgallery/R-d-4.jpg" width="250">

These images are generated by recognizing that:

1. Her paintings resemble sparse matrices (but in a very curious way) 
3. They also come very close to using a color palette that is rotationally symmetrical on a color wheel

The script can:

1. Generate these matrices
2. Rotate them rectangular to diagonal, and diagonal to rectangular -- 45 degrees only

In doing so, it demonstrates the curious relation between her compositions and the sparse, banded matrices that appear in complex simulations and have advantages when it comes to lossless compression. Riley's canvases as represented in the checkerboard format are inner-sparse -- zeroes every other item. But these have corresponding, square, truncated-banded matrices that are outer-sparse -- triangular buffers of zeroes around a central band.

So for instance in a 3-color canvas I used 4 color values (1=purple, 2=green, 3=salmon, and 4=white) even though I had a white background.<br/>
In other words, despite the white circles being indistinguishable from the white canvas, null entries were 0 and white entries were 4

1) Inner-sparse "rectangular" matrix to outer-sparse square "diagonal" matrix by ... sort of ... rotating them clockwise 45 degrees

	```
	rect_to_diag_clockwise(rect_matrix)
	
	Will take this Rectangular Matrix:
	
	[[2 0 1 0 4]
	 [0 1 0 4 0]
	 [3 0 1 0 4]]
	 
	And return this Diagonal Matrix:
	
	[[0 2 0 0]
	 [3 1 1 0]
	 [0 1 4 4]
	 [0 0 4 0]]
	 ```

2) Similarly, outer-sparse "diagonal" matrices can be trasformed into inner-sparse "rectangular" matrices by ... sort of ... rotating them counterclockwise 45 degrees
	
	```
	Diagonal Matrix
	
	[[0 2 0 0]
	 [3 1 1 0]
	 [0 1 4 4]
	 [0 0 4 0]]
	 
	Rectangular Matrix
	
	[[2 0 1 0 4]
	 [0 1 0 4 0]
	 [3 0 1 0 4]]
	 ```

The script can also generate a random binary, rectangular checkerboard matrices in Riley's format:
	
	1) Binary checkerboards:
	messengers.make_rect_checkerboard(M,N)

	Will give you an MxN matrix like:
	[[1 0 1 0 1]
	[0 1 0 1 0]
	[1 0 1 0 1]]

	2) Unique ID checkerboards:
	make_rectangular_unique_id_matrix(M,N)
	Will give you an MxN matrix like:
	[[1 0 2 0 3]
	 [0 4 0 5 0]
	 [6 0 7 0 8]]


## visualizers.py

This script contains a few visualization functions.<br/>

In most cases, you need to pass it:<br/>
a. the matrix<br/>
b. output filename<br/>
c. basic layout information:<br/>

	l=distance between circles' radii
	r=circles' radii
	color dictionary, usually in the format of
		key:[(R,G,B),probability [optional],color_name [optional]]

		e.g.,
		color_dict={
		1:[(170,163,195),.2,'purple'],
		2:[(139,193,137),.2,'green'],
		3:[(218,181,171),.2,'salmon'],
		4:[(255,255,255),.4,'white']
		}



Use PIL to create png's out of the matrix:<br/>
visualizers.pillow(matrix,fname,l,r,color_dict)

Use Fabric.js to create (minimally for now) interactive html files with fabric.js<br/>
visualizers.fabricjs(matrix,fname,l,r,color_dict)

Use text to print out raw text representations of an array of matrices.<br/>
visualizers.text([matrix1,matrix2...])


-------------------
demo_painter.py is a test implementation of messengers.py and visualizers.py

It takes 3 parameters:<br/>
M = rectangular Riley matrix's rows (must be odd number)<br/>
N = rectangular Riley matrix's columns (must be odd number)<br/>
iterations = number of png's to create (default is 1)

Produces corresponding rectangular and diagonal Riley matrices with randomly-assigned colors.

First by generating the rectangular Riley binary checkerboard.<br/>
Then by randomly assigning colors using probability weights (hard-coded in right now as the above color dictionary).<br/>
Then by transforming that colored rectangular Riley matrix into its corresponding diagonal Riley matrix.

It generates 1 text file with all the matrices printed.

It generates 2 html files (diagonal and rectangular matrices) with fabric.js interactivity.

It generates 2 png files (diag & rect) *for every iteration*.

So:<br/>
python3 demo_painter.py 5 7 3<br/>

Generates:
	
	5x7 random-colored rectangular Riley matrix<br/>
	6x6 corresponding banded Riley matrix<br/>
	1 txt file<br/>
	2 html files<br/>
	6 png files<br/>
